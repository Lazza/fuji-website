1. Connect the destination drive to the target Mac computer
2. Open the Fuji DMG and click on _Full Disk Access Settings.url_
3. If the window has a "lock" icon, unlock it
4. Drag the _Fuji.app_ file on the list of authorized apps **and ensure the
   toggle is enabled**
5. Now you can run _Fuji.app_
6. When prompted, insert the password for the administrator user

## ⚠️ Important notes

1. Before starting the acquisition, you must specify on what drive(s) you want
to store the temporary sparseimage and the final DMG file. Both values are
`/Volumes/Fuji` by default and the _image name_ parameter will be used to make
a new directory inside those locations.

2. You must not save the disk images on the same drive you are acquiring!

3. If you use the Rsync mode, it is recommended to **close all other
applications before proceeding, especially Apple Mail,** otherwise some data
might not be collected.
