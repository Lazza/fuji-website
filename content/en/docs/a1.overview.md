Fuji is a free, open source program for performing forensic acquisition of Mac
computers. It should work on any modern Intel or Apple Silicon device, as it
leverages standard executables provided by macOS.

Fuji performs a so-called *live acquisition* (the computer must be turned on) of
*logical* nature, i.e. it includes only existing files. The tool generates a DMG
file that can be imported in several digital forensics programs.

It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 3).
