To use Fuji at its fullest extent, you will need a device for the software
itself and one or more external drives for acquiring evidence.

This section describes how to prepare both.


## Preparing a Fuji Cartridge drive

A **Fuji Cartridge** is an external USB device used for the software itself. It
is usually a USB key.

While having a dual-connector (USB-A and USB-C) drive is suggested, you can use
any USB thumbdrive as long as it is **at least 256 MB of size** and it can be
connected to the target Mac.

Any spare USB key will suffice.

You should create as many **Fuji Cartridge** drives as you need, keeping in mind
that they don't have to be connected during the whole acquisition (if running in
recovery mode).

Here's how to create one:

1. Download the latest version of the universal Fuji DMG [from GitHub][github]
2. Download and install [balenaEtcher][etcher]
3. Run Etcher and burn the DMG onto your USB drive

✅ You can use **any computer** running macOS, Windows, or Linux to do this.


## Preparing a drive for evidence

This is pretty straightforward:

1. Partition your destination drive using the **exFAT** file system
2. Set the volume label as `Fuji`

Optionally you can download and copy the universal Fuji DMG in the drive, if you
plan to run it from a live macOS environment without a separate **Fuji
Cartridge** drive.

**Congratulations!** You are now ready to use Fuji. 🚀
