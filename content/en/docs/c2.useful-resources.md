These are a few of several resources that have helped in the development of this
software. Some include further reading on relevant topics:

- The question [How do I copy a list of folders recursively, ignoring
  errors?][superuser_question] has a couple of interesting leads, mentioning
  Rsync and Ditto.
- An answer to [Can I use ditto on OS X to sync two folders on the same
  machine?][superuser_answer] summarizes the difference between using Ditto and
  Rsync, taken from the following article.
- The [Guide to Backing Up Mac OS X][bombich_guide] by CCC's developer Mike
  Bombich includes a detailed description of Ditto, Rsync and ASR (with the
  purpose of creating full disk backups).
- [A user’s guide to Disk Images][disk_images] describes the features of sparse
  bundles and sparse images.
- WithSecure Labs has an [excellent article][sysdiagnose_post] on Sysdiagnose.
