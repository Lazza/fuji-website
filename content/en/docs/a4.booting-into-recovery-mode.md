The procedure for starting Fuji in recovery mode is slightly different,
depending on the architecture.

It is recommended that the Mac stays connected to AC plug for the whole
procedure. If the Mac has only one USB port, you may want to use a USB-C dongle
that supports Power Delivery.


## Apple Silicon Macs

Turn off the Mac and connect your **Fuji Cartridge** drive. If you have enough
USB ports, connect the destination drive as well.

Press and hold the power button until you see _Loading startup options..._
then release the button.

  class="icon-figure"
>}}

Look for **FujiApp** in the list of available options and select it.

✅ Fuji will automatically copy itself to a RAM-disk and start. **After Fuji is
loaded, you can disconnect the Fuji Cartridge drive** and connect your
destination drive, if you didn't do it before.


## Intel Macs

Turn off the Mac and connect your **Fuji Cartridge** drive. If you have enough
USB ports, connect the destination drive as well.

Start macOS in recovery mode by pressing and releasing the power button, then
immediately holding <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>. Please refer to the [official
Apple website][apple-recovery] in case you are having trouble
starting recovery mode.

After the recovery environment has been loaded, select **Utilities** &rarr;
**Terminal** and then issue the following command:

    /Volumes/FujiApp/start.sh

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

✅ Fuji will automatically copy itself to a RAM-disk and start. **After Fuji is
loaded, you can disconnect the Fuji Cartridge drive** and connect your
destination drive, if you didn't do it before.


## ⚠️ Important notes

1. If the Mac is protected with FileVault, you must provide a valid password.

2. Before starting the acquisition, you must specify on what drive(s) you want
to store temporary files and the final DMG file. Both values are
`/Volumes/Fuji` by default and the _image name_ parameter will be used to make
a new directory inside those locations.

3. The values will be pre-filled only if you connected the destination drive
before starting Fuji.

3. You must not save the disk images on the same drive you are acquiring!

4. Fuji works on Macs running **macOS 10.10 or newer.**
