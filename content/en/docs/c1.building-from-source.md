Fuji is developed as a Universal2 application using the **3.10 release** of
Python from [Python.org][python].

You can create a virtual environment with:

    /usr/local/bin/python3.10 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

The DMG file can be built by using the included Pyinstaller script:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pyinstaller Fuji.spec

The build process must be executed **from a computer running macOS.**

The following is a list of prerequisites if you want to modify the source code
or run Fuji from source:

- macOS version 11 or later
- Python version 3.10 (tested with [3.10.11][python310])
