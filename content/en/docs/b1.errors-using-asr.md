In past versions of Fuji, ASR was the recommended method for acquisition, due to
its simplicity and speed. This is no longer the case, because some errors may
occur, especially in recent macOS versions.

This page describes the most common issues that may be encountered.

## ASR acquisition fails with "operation not permitted"

First of all, ensure that Fuji is in the list of apps with _Full Disk Access_
permissions and the toggle is active. Close and re-open Fuji.

If the issue persists, try to acquire the _Data_ volume instead of the root
volume. It is usually called **Macintosh HD - Data** and it includes all user
files, settings and installed applications.

Fuji testers have reported that this generally solves the issue.

## ASR acquisition fails with error 49xxx (like 49186, 49197, or similar)

This has often been reported on macOS version 13 (Ventura). The APFS volume may
need to be checked using the _First Aid_ function of Disk Utility (`fsck`).

If this does not work, try acquiring the **Macintosh HD - Data** volume instead.

In some extreme cases you might need to upgrade the operating system to a newer
version to complete ASR acquisition. Instead, you should consider using Rsync.

The Rsync acquisition method works even on damaged file systems and can be used
to acquire only a single directory instead of the whole drive. Files that cannot
be read are skipped.
