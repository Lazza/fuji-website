## ⚠️ Important notes

1. Before starting the acquisition, you must specify on what drive(s) you want
to store temporary files and the final DMG file. Both values are
`/Volumes/Fuji` by default and the _image name_ parameter will be used to make
a new directory inside those locations.

2. You must not save the disk images on the same drive you are acquiring!

3. If you use the Rsync mode, it is recommended to **close all other
applications before proceeding, especially Apple Mail,** otherwise some data
might not be collected.
